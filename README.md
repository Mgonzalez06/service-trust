## Overview

Our platform allows older adults to hire caregivers based on their reputation, securely recorded and managed on the Base blockchain via NFTs.

## Problems to Resolve

### Digital Financial Inclusion

A significant portion of the population, especially from marginalized ethnic groups, remains unbanked. This creates barriers to financial services and fair treatment. Our platform enables seamless onboarding to digital payments through cryptocurrency, promoting financial inclusion and fairness.

### Specialized Employment Platform

Currently, there is a gap in the market for a specialized platform like LinkedIn focused on connecting elders with caregivers. Traditional platforms are not tailored to this niche, making it challenging to discover caregivers, especially those without professional titles. Trust is a major hurdle, as most elders rely on personal referrals for trustworthiness.

### Growing Need for Caregivers

With the global population aging, the demand for caregivers is increasing rapidly. The age pyramid is expanding at the top, and there is a critical need to address this growing sector. Our platform will help meet this demand by providing a trusted marketplace for elders to find reliable caregivers.

### Trust and Reputation

One of the main challenges in hiring caregivers is establishing trust. Our platform addresses this by leveraging blockchain technology to record the tenure and reputation of caregivers through NFTs. This ensures that trust can be built on verifiable and immutable records rather than solely on personal referrals.

### Economic Opportunities

By introducing a reputation-based marketplace, we create economic opportunities for caregivers from all backgrounds, enabling them to build and showcase their reputation. This opens up new employment avenues and supports economic mobility.

### Technological Advancement

Adopting blockchain technology for managing caregiver reputations and P2P payments introduces innovation in the elder care sector. It enhances transparency, security, and efficiency, paving the way for future technological advancements in this field.

### Addressing Trust Deficit

In today's fragmented and disconnected caregiver market, trust deficits hinder hiring decisions. Our platform bridges this gap by offering a transparent and reliable reputation system, ensuring both caregivers and elders can engage with confidence.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Tenure and reputation history of caregivers stored on-chain
- **Reputation NFTs**: Caregivers receive NFTs representing their good service reputation
- **P2P Payments**: Direct peer-to-peer payments to service providers (caregivers)
- **NFTs can serve as a Governance Token (Pending)**: As top tier caregivers accumulate NFTs on their profile so increases their power to influence new features and changes in the marketplace. Democratizing the job market itself.
